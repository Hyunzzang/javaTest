/**
 * Problem
 * You are given an integer array containing 1 to n but one of the number from 1 to n in the array is missing.
 * You need to provide optimum solution to find the missing number.
 * Number can not be repeated in the arry.
 *
 * Solution
 * 1. Find the sum of n number using formula n=n*(n+1)/2
 * 2. Find the sum of elements present in given array.
 * 3. Substract (sum of n numbers â€“ sum of elements present in the array).
